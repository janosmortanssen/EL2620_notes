# Homework 0 - Population dynamics
![Lynx and hare](lynxhare.gif)
Suppose that there is a grassy island supporting populations of two species $x$ and $y$. If the populations are large then it is reasonable to let the normalized populations be continuous functions of time (so that $x=1$ might represent a population of e.g., 1000 specimen). We propose the following simple model of the change in population:
\begin{equation}
\dot x(t) = f_x(x(t),y(t))=x(t)(a+bx(t)+cy(t))\\
\dot y(t) = f_y(x(t),y(t))=y(t)(d+ey(t)+fx(t))\\
\end{equation}
where $x$ and $y$ are non-negative functions and $a$, $b$, . . . , $f$ are constants. Let us start with discussing the model heuristically to gain some insight. 
Consider first a single species with no interaction with the other: $\dot x=x(a+bx)$. If $x$ is a herbivore (plant-eater) species it is reasonable to assume that it can maintain a certain population by itself (there will be enough food). If the initial population is small it will grow, hence $a>0$ , but if the population grows too large there will be more competition for food and more deceases will spread. Hence, $b<0$. This enables non-zero equilibria for the species when they are alone; the populations will not grow unbounded but reach an finite equilibrium. If $x$ is a carnivore (meat-eater) it requires the other (plant-eater) species in order to maintain a population. By itself it will die out, $a<0$. Also here we could argue that large populations increase the internal rivalry and then $b\le0$. Equivalent conditions hold for the parameters $d$ and $e$ if we consider the species $y$.
